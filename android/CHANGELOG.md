## [v1.0.1] — 2026-03-03

### Added
- **Smart auto-connect** — service auto-starts on launch when already on WiFi; `ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback` triggers a fresh connection attempt whenever WiFi is (re)gained
- **Exponential backoff with max 3 attempts** — on failure the app waits 5 s → 15 s → 30 s between retries then gives up (was: infinite retry loop)
- **Idle state** — after 3 consecutive failed TCP connections the service stops retrying; `VehicleState.isIdle` propagates this to the UI
- **WiFi gating** — connection attempts are skipped when on mobile data only; shows "No WiFi" notification
- **`reconnect()` method** on `CanDataService` — resets attempt counter and starts fresh; called from the header RETRY badge
- **Three-state header badge** — `● LIVE` (green) when connected, `⊙ RETRY` (gold) when idle, `○ OFFLINE` (red) otherwise; tapping any badge performs the correct action

### Fixed
- Continuous connect/disconnect notification spam when MeatPi is not present or phone is not on the WiCAN network

## [v1.0.0] — 2026-03-01

### Added
- **TPMS screen** — Real tire pressure (PSI) and temperature via BCM Mode 22
- **AFR actual/desired** — Wideband lambda from PCM with AFR display
- **Electronic Throttle Control** — ETC actual vs desired angle
- **Throttle Inlet Pressure** — TIP actual vs desired (kPa → PSI)
- **Wastegate Duty Cycle** — WGDC desired percentage
- **Variable Cam Timing** — VCT intake and exhaust angles
- **Oil life percentage** and **knock correction** via PCM
- **Multi-ECU header management** — Automatic ATSH switching (PCM `0x7E0`, BCM `0x726`)
- **CTRL screen** — Drive mode (N/S/T/D), ESC toggle, Launch Control, ASS kill, connection info
- **Settings dialog** — WiCAN host/port configurable from within the app
- **Android Auto support** — full Compose UI mirroring the phone app (7 screens)
- **openRS_ branding** — Nitrous Blue / Frost White theme, launcher icon, app name
- **Edge-to-edge layout** — proper status bar and navigation bar inset handling (Android 15+)
- Foreground service with persistent notification and peak tracking (boost, RPM, G-force)
- 33 OBD PIDs across Mode 1 and Mode 22 (PCM + BCM)
- 16+ real-time CAN frame decoders (RPM, boost, speed, AWD split, G-forces, wheel speeds, drive mode, ESC, gear, TPMS)

### Architecture
- Hybrid ATMA + OBD time-sliced polling — continuous CAN sniffing with 4 Hz OBD queries
- Single WiCAN-USB-C3 adapter via ELM327 TCP on port 3333
